## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites:
1. **Node.js**: Make sure Node.js is installed on your machine.
2. **MongoDB**: Set up MongoDB, either locally or using a service like MongoDB Atlas.
3. **Google Maps API Key**: Youâ€™ll need to obtain a Google Maps API key for the location functionality.

### Backend Setup:

1. Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/address-management.git
    cd address-management
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm install
    ```

3. Set up MongoDB (local or cloud). Update the connection string in your backend app (likely in `server.js` or `.env` file).

4. Start the backend server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

   The backend will run on `http://localhost:5000`.

### Frontend Setup:

1. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm install
    ```

2. Set your Google Maps API key in `frontend/src/Home.js` and `frontend/src/EditAddress.js` (replace `YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` with your actual key):
    ```javascript
    const googleMapsApiKey = "YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY";
    ```

3. Start the frontend:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

   The frontend will run on `http://localhost:3000`.
